working file is in maze_current.ipynb
report.ipynb shows everything I have done thus far 

TODO: 
- check transition method, as the minotaur seems to only move left and if left is not working he goes right. He does not go through walls or up if possible. 
- Check why the survival rate for value iteration is the same if the minotaur has to move or can stay -> check value iteration function 
- Check if the probabilities for T > 21 and minotaur can stay make sense
- Check reasoning why the probability of winning go down if minotaur can stay.
